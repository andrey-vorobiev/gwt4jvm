There is a sample that shows how to use GWT Java Client to load test GWT applications. It consists
of a web application called Movie Chart (simplified GWT-based clone of IMDB Top 250 Movies that was
conceived to show the list of movies sorted by rating which is formed by votes of registered users)
and a load test that simulates typical usage scenario: login, get the list of movies, then rate one
of them and finally logout.

Movie Chart application requires JDK (1.6 or above) and Maven 3. Once they are installed, compile
the project: 

  mvn package

Then start Movie Chart application (it will available at http://localhost:8080/):

  mvn jetty:run-exploded -Djetty.port=8080

While it is running launch the load test by entering:

  mvn test -P test -DmoduleBaseURL=http://localhost:8080/mc/ \
                   -DconcurrentUsers=100                     \
                   -DrampUpSeconds=10                        \
                   -DtestDurationSeconds=30

And it will start and maintain the load of hundred concurrent users executing scenario described
above. The load will be ramped up in 10 seconds and will be lasting for half a minute.
