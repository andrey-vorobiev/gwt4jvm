There is a sample that shows how to load test GWT applications with a help of gwt4jvm framework. It
consists of a web application called Movie Chart (simplified GWT-based clone of IMDB Top 250 Movies
that should show the list of movies sorted by rating which is formed by votes of registered users)
and a load test that simulates typical usage scenario: login, get the list of movies, then rate one
of them and finally logout.

Movie Chart application requires JDK (version 1.6 or above) and Maven (version 3). Once both of them
are installed, compile the project: 

  mvn package

Then start Movie Chart application (it will available at http://localhost:8080/):

  mvn jetty:run-exploded -Djetty.port=8080

While it is running launch the load test by entering:

  mvn test -P test -DmoduleBaseURL=http://localhost:8080/mc/ \
                   -DconcurrentUsers=100                     \
                   -DrampUpSeconds=10                        \
                   -DtestDurationSeconds=30

And it will start and maintain the load of hundred concurrent users executing scenario described at
the beginning. The load will be ramped up in 10 seconds and will be lasting for half a minute.
